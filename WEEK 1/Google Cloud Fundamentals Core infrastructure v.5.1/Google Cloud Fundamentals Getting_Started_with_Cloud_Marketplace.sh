# Task 1. Sign in to the Google Cloud Console
# For each lab, you get a new Google Cloud project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

# Sign in to Qwiklabs using an incognito window.

# Note the lab's access time (for example, 1:15:00), and make sure you can finish within that time.
# There is no pause feature. You can restart if needed, but you have to start at the beginning.

# When ready, click Start lab.

# Note your lab credentials (Username and Password). You will use them to sign in to the Google Cloud Console.

# Click Open Google Console.

# Click Use another account and copy/paste credentials for this lab into the prompts.
# If you use other credentials, you'll receive errors or incur charges.

# Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.

# Note: Do not click End Lab unless you have finished the lab or want to restart it. This clears your work and removes the project.

# Task 2. Use Cloud Marketplace to deploy a LAMP stack
# In the Google Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Marketplace.

# In the search bar, type LAMP and then press ENTER.

# In the search results, click LAMP Packaged by Bitnami.

# If you choose another LAMP stack, such as the Google Click to Deploy offering, the lab instructions will not work as expected.

# On the LAMP page, click Launch.

# If this is your first time using Compute Engine, the Compute Engine API must be initialized before you can continue.

# For Zone, select the deployment zone that Qwiklabs assigned to you.

# Leave the remaining settings as their defaults.

# Accept the Google Cloud Marketplace Terms of Service near the bottom of the page.

# Click Deploy.

# If a Welcome to Deployment Manager message appears, click Close to dismiss it.

# The status of the deployment appears in the console window: lampstack-1 is being deployed. When the deployment of the infrastructure is complete, the status changes to lampstack-1 has been deployed.

# After the software is installed, a summary of the details for the instance, including the site address, is displayed.

# Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
# Use Cloud Marketplace to deploy a LAMP stack

# Task 3. Verify your deployment
# When the deployment is complete, click the Site address link in the right pane. (If the website is not responding, wait 30 seconds and try again.) If you see a redirection notice, click on that link to view your new site.

# Alternatively, you can click Visit the site in the Get started with LAMP Packaged by Bitnami section of the page. A new browser tab displays a congratulations message. This page confirms that, as part of the LAMP stack, the Apache HTTP Server is running.

# Close the congratulations browser tab.

# On the Google Cloud Console, under Get started with LAMP Packaged by Bitnami, click SSH.

# In a new window, a secure login shell session on your virtual machine appears.

# In the SSH window, to change the current working directory to /opt/bitnami, execute the following command:

cd /opt/bitnami

# To copy the phpinfo.php script from the installation directory to a publicly accessible location under the web server document root, execute the following command:

 sudo sh -c 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > apache2/htdocs/phpinfo.php'

# The phpinfo.php script displays your PHP configuration. It is often used to verify a new PHP installation.

# To close the SSH window, execute the following command:

 exit

# Open a new browser tab.

# Enter the following URL, and replace SITE_ADDRESS with the URL in the Site address field in the right pane of the lampstack page.

http://SITE_ADDRESS/phpinfo.php

# A summary of the PHP configuration of your server is displayed.

# Note: If you can't see the web page in the browser on your corporate laptop: If possible, exit any corporate VPN/network and try again. Enter the IP address on another device, such as a tablet or even a phone.
# Close the phpinfo tab.

# Congratulations!
# In this lab, you deployed a LAMP stack to a Compute Engine instance.

# End your lab
