# Task 1. Explore the default network
# Each Google Cloud project has a default network with subnets, routes, and firewall rules.

# View the subnets
# The default network has a subnet in each Google Cloud region.

# In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click VPC network > VPC networks.
# Notice the default network with its subnets.
# Each subnet is associated with a Google Cloud region and a private RFC 1918 CIDR block for its internal IP addresses range and a gateway.

# View the routes
# Routes tell VM instances and the VPC network how to send traffic from an instance to a destination, either inside the network or outside Google Cloud. Each VPC network comes with some default routes to route traffic among its subnets and send traffic from eligible instances to the internet.

# In the left pane, click Routes.
# Notice that there is a route for each subnet and one for the Default internet gateway (0.0.0.0/0).
# These routes are managed for you, but you can create custom static routes to direct some packets to specific destinations. For example, you can create a route that sends all outbound traffic to an instance configured as a NAT gateway.

# View the Firewall rules
# Each VPC network implements a distributed virtual firewall that you can configure. Firewall rules allow you to control which packets are allowed to travel to which destinations. Every VPC network has two implied firewall rules that block all incoming connections and allow all outgoing connections.

# In the left pane, click Firewall.
# Notice that there are 4 Ingress firewall rules for the default network:
# default-allow-icmp
# default-allow-rdp
# default-allow-ssh
# default-allow-internal
# Note: These firewall rules allow ICMP, RDP, and SSH ingress traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) and all TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic within the network (10.128.0.0/9). The Targets, Filters, Protocols/ports, and Action columns explain these rules.
# Delete the Firewall rules
# In the left pane, click Firewall.
# Select all default network firewall rules.
# Click Delete.
# Click Delete to confirm the deletion of the firewall rules.
# Firewall page with all listed firewall rules selected and the delete button highlighted

# Delete the default network
# In the left pane, click VPC networks.
# Select the default network.
# Click Delete VPC network.
# Click Delete to confirm the deletion of the default network.
# Wait for the network to be deleted before continuing.
# In the left pane, click Routes.
# Notice that there are no routes.
# In the left pane, click Firewall.
# Notice that there are no firewall rules.
# Note: Without a VPC network, there are no routes and no firewall rules!
# Try to create a VM instance
# Verify that you cannot create a VM instance without a VPC network.

# On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
# Click Create instance.
# Accept the default values and click Create. Notice the error.

# Note: The External IP addresses for both VM instances are ephemeral. If an instance is stopped, any ephemeral external IP addresses assigned to the instance are released back into the general Compute Engine pool and become available for use by other projects.
# When a stopped instance is started again, a new ephemeral external IP address is assigned to the instance. Alternatively, you can reserve a static external IP address, which assigns the address to your project indefinitely until you explicitly release it.
# Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
# Create a VPC network and VM instance

# Task 3. Explore the connectivity for VM instances
# Explore the connectivity for the VM instances. Specifically, try to SSH to your VM instances using tcp:22, and ping both the internal and external IP addresses of your VM instances using ICMP. Then explore the effects of the firewall rules on connectivity by removing the firewall rules individually.

# Verify connectivity for the VM instances
# The firewall rules that you created with mynetwork allow ingress SSH and ICMP traffic from within mynetwork (internal IP) and outside that network (external IP).

# On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
# Note the external and internal IP addresses for mynet-eu-vm.
# For mynet-us-vm, click SSH to launch a terminal and connect.
# Note: You can SSH because of the allow-ssh firewall rule, which allows incoming traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) for tcp:22. The SSH connection works seamlessly because Compute Engine generates an SSH key for you and stores it in one of the following locations:
# By default, Compute Engine adds the generated key to project or instance metadata.
# If your account is configured to use OS Login, Compute Engine stores the generated key with your user account.
# Alternatively, you can control access to Linux instances by creating SSH keys and editing public SSH key metadata.
# To test connectivity to mynet-eu-vm's internal IP, run the following command, replacing mynet-eu-vm's internal IP:

ping -c 3 10.10.10.1

# You can ping mynet-eu-vm's internal IP because of the allow-custom firewall rule.

# To test connectivity to mynet-eu-vm's external IP, run the following command, replacing mynet-eu-vm's external IP:

 ping -c 3 34.34.10.165


# Which firewall rule allows the ping to mynet-eu-vm's external IP address?

# mynetwork-allow-ssh

# mynetwork-allow-rdp

# mynetwork-allow-icmp

# mynetwork-allow-custom

# Note: You can SSH to mynet-us-vm and ping mynet-eu-vm's internal and external IP address as expected. Alternatively, you can SSH to mynet-eu-vm and ping mynet-us-vm's internal and external IP address, which also works.
# Remove the allow-icmp firewall rules
