# Overview
# In this lab you will learn the fundamentals of prompt engineering for context using Generative AI and Google Cloud.

# If you are new to Generative AI or looking for an overview of how to get started, you are in the right place. Read on to learn about the specifics of this lab and areas that you will get hands-on practice with.

# In this lab learn use a chat application to interact and learn:

# The basics of prompt engineering
# Why context in relation to AI is important
# How to work with Generative AI
# Prerequisites
# Over the course of this lab the following elements are required:

# Vertex AI
# Generative AI models
# Task 1. Access the Chat Application
# Open the service url to gain access to the lab chat application.

# Note: The chat bot link works in both a normal browser tab and an incognito window. An initial loading screen will appear while the lab data is being prepared.
# From here you will be able to interact with a Generative AI model during the course of this lab.

# Chatbot main screen
# Note: The above image is the main chat screen. The chat screen includes multiple personas reflecting different knowledge domains. Each persona has specific but limited abilities to demonstrate the functionality of generative ai on a defined topic.
# The lab mimics a chat application interface to provide access to a generative ai model. Select a persona from the contacts list to initiate a discussion on a specified topic.

# Note: The application uses a simplified version of the chat/bison-001 model. In this demo, each query is distinct and therefore, the user must input the full context per query.
# The application allows the user to perform interactions with the generative ai from Google Cloud. From here you will be able to sample the power of generative ai in a scenario reflecting real-world usage.

# Task 2. Using Prompt Engineering
# In this lab we will interact with a Generative AI model to discuss topic. Don't worry, if you don't know much about this, use it as a learning exercise.

# Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can be used to create new information, such as text, images, or music. This makes it a powerful tool for learning about topic, as it can be used to generate realistic new content.

# Generative AI can be used with language learning in a number of ways, including:

# Intelligent Chatbots for Conversation Practice: Generative AI-powered chatbots can mimic real conversations with native speakers. They can adapt to your skill level, offering targeted corrections and suggestions in real-time. This provides an immersive and low-stress environment to practice your speaking and listening skills.
# Customized Learning Paths: AI can analyze your strengths and weaknesses and suggest a personalized learning path. This might include grammar exercises, vocabulary lists, and reading passages tailored to your level and interests.
# Generating Language Exercises: AI can create fill-in-the-blank exercises, sentence completion tasks, or dialogue prompts specifically relevant to your learning journey. This provides abundant practice material.
# Translation with Contextual Understanding: AI-powered translation tools can go beyond literal word-for-word translation. They can capture the nuances and context of a sentence, helping you understand how language is used in real-world scenarios.
# Interactive Stories: Generative AI can create interactive narratives or role-playing scenarios where you engage with characters to assist with topic. These stories can adapt based on your choices and language input, making you an active participant in an AI based language world.
# Creating Visual Context: AI tools can generate images or videos that illustrate vocabulary or language concepts. This visual association can enhance your understanding and memory retention.
# Here are some specific examples of how generative AI is being used in education today:

# Creating customized practice problems, quizzes, or even writing prompts tailored to a student's strengths and weaknesses.
# Generative AI can craft immersive simulations or virtual scenarios. Students practicing history might interact with historical figures, or language learners could converse with AI-powered chatbots. This hands-on approach deepens understanding and makes learning more exciting.
# Creating learning materials in different formats, like audio descriptions for visuals or generating text in multiple languages.
# generate different viewpoints on a topic, helping students develop critical thinking skills. Imagine analyzing a historical event from various perspectives or exploring scientific concepts through AI-created simulations.
# Task 3. Context is Key
# Generative AI Chat Bot needs context to answer questions. In the demo lab bot we have taken away some of its smarts to show the importance of context.

# In the application we can put our questions to the AI model. To start, let's establish some basics around the importance of context relating to crafting questions.

# Click on the persona persona
# Note: Clicking on the chatbot persona will open the chat interface. From this interface you can interact with the generative ai model.
# Start by saying hello to the chat bot, enter the following text
# Hello
# Copied!
# Note: The chatbot will respond to this initial interaction with a helpful message to let you know it's ready to interact with you.
# Let's start by asking a broad question to the AI
# How would I prepare for "topic"?
# Copied!
# Let's add some specifics to that question
# What are some good sources to help with "list"?
# Copied!
# Let's ask a specific knowledge based question to the AI
# Can you list the main topics in the "list" exam?
# Copied!
# Amazingly, we have just set the context for our topic journey. The Generative AI model has knowledge on lots of subjects. Here we are interested in finding out more about topic.

# Task 4. Improving topic knowledge
# Now that we have learned the basics, let's improve our knowledge of the list.

# Note: Remember generative ai models are based on data taken from a point in time. The models need to be continually generated when working with time based information.
# Let's ask a general question about the topic
# Can you list three important facts about "list" exam?
# Copied!
# Note: We should always verify the information presented.
# Let's ask a specific question relating to an associated item
# Where can I find out more information on "topic" exam?
# Copied!
# Lets ask a linking question
# What happens after I pass the "item" exam ?
# Copied!
# Let's ask a broader question
# Can you give me the URL for the "item" exam?
# Copied!
# Let's expand our query to generate some poetry
# Can you write a five line poem about "item" exam?
# Copied!
# Note: The chatbot isnt perfect, but it makes a great study partner. If you have questions on specific elements of revision, this can be a handy tool to add to your existing workflow. Remember the information is rule based, so always valid the responses.
# Great, it looks like you really know your stuff. Let's move onto the final assessment.

# Task 5. Taking the Assessment
# Finally, answer the assessment question based on topic.

# Note: The lab assessment is accessed using the bottom navigation bar. Click on the Assess option to move to this screen. Answer correctly to pass the assessment. Once done, you can return from the chatbot application to the lab interface.
# Click on the assess bottom navigation button to reveal the lab question. Select the correct answer to successfully complete the lab.

# Chatbot assessment.
# To successfully complete the lab assessment, each question presented must be answered correctly.

# Note: The assessment validation button is available at the end of the question list. Once all questions are answered correctly, click this button to ensure the chatbot automatically allocates points in the running lab.
# Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

# Successfully complete the quiz assessment

# Congratulations!
# In just 30 minutes, you developed an understanding of Generative AI and the prompt engineering. You are now ready to take more labs.
