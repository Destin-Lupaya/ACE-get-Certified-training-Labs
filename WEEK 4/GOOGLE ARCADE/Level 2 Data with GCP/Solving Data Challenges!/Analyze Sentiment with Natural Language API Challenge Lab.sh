# Overview
# In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

# When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

# To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

# Setup and requirements
# Before you click the Start Lab button
# Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

# This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

# To complete this lab, you need:

# Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
# Note: Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
# Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
# Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.
# Challenge scenario
# You recently joined an organization and are working as a junior cloud engineer as part of a team. You have been assigned machine learning (ML) projects and one of your client requirements is to use the Cloud Natural Language API service in Google Cloud to perform tasks for the completion of a project.

# You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for the tasks that follow.

# Your challenge
# For this challenge, you are asked to set up Google Docs and perform sentiment analysis on some reviews provided by customers, analyze syntax and parts of speech using the Natural language API, and create a Natural Language API request for a language other than English.

# You need to:

# Create an API key.
# Set up Google Docs and call the Natural Language API.
# Analyze syntax and parts of speech with the Natural Language API.
# Perform multilingual natural language processing.
# For this challenge lab, a virtual machine (VM) instance named Instance name has been configured for you to complete tasks 3 and 4.

# Some standards you should follow:

# Ensure that any needed APIs (such as the Cloud Natural Language API) are successfully enabled.
# Each task is described in detail below, good luck!

# Task 1. Create an API key
# For this task, you need to create an API key to use in this and other tasks when sending a request to the Natural Language API.

# Save the API key to use in other tasks.

# Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
# Create an API key

# Task 2. Set up Google Docs and call the Natural Language API
# For this task, you need to set up Google Docs to use the Natural Language API and recognize the sentiment of selected text in a Google Docs document and highlight parts of it based on sentiment.

# Text is highlighted in red for negative sentiment, green for positive sentiment, and yellow for neutral sentiment.

# Create a new Google Docs document.

# Use the following code in Apps Script. Modify the code to add your API key and enter the URL of the Natural Language API to analyze entity sentiment.

#   /**
#   * @OnlyCurrentDoc
#   *
#   * The above comment directs Apps Script to limit the scope of file
#   * access for this add-on. It specifies that this add-on will only
#   * attempt to read or modify the files in which the add-on is used,
#   * and not all of the user's files. The authorization request message
