# Overview
# Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

# What you'll do
# In this hands-on lab you will learn how to use the Cloud console to:

# Create a storage bucket
# Upload objects to the bucket
# Create folders and subfolders in the bucket
# Make objects in a storage bucket publicly accessible
# Setup and requirements
# Before you click the Start Lab button
# Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

# This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

# To complete this lab, you need:

# Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
# Note: Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
# Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
# Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.
# How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console
# Click the Start Lab button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details panel with the following:

# The Open Google Cloud console button
# Time remaining
# The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
# Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
# Click Open Google Cloud console (or right-click and select Open Link in Incognito Window if you are running the Chrome browser).

# The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.

# Tip: Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

# Note: If you see the Choose an account dialog, click Use Another Account.
# If necessary, copy the Username below and paste it into the Sign in dialog.

# "Username"
# Copied!
# You can also find the Username in the Lab Details panel.

# Click Next.

# Copy the Password below and paste it into the Welcome dialog.

# "Password"
# Copied!
# You can also find the Password in the Lab Details panel.

# Click Next.

# Important: You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
# Note: Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
# Click through the subsequent pages:

# Accept the terms and conditions.
# Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
# Do not sign up for free trials.
# After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

# Note: To view a menu with a list of Google Cloud products and services, click the Navigation menu at the top-left. Navigation menu icon
# Task 1. Create a bucket
# Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data in Cloud Storage.

# To create a bucket:

# In the Cloud console, go to Navigation menu > Cloud Storage > Buckets.

# Click + Create:

#  Cloud Console Storage Browser. Create Bucket button is highlighted.

# Enter your bucket information and click Continue to complete each step:

# Name your bucket: Enter a unique name for your bucket. For this lab, you can use your Project ID as the bucket name because it will always be unique.
# Bucket naming rules:

# Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name, because the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.

# Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Names containing dots require verification.

# Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.

# Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.

# Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).

# Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix. Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings of "google".*

# Also, for DNS compliance and future compatibility, you should not use underscores (_) or have a period adjacent to another period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not valid in DNS names.

# Choose Region for Location type and <filled in at lab start> for Location.

# Choose Standard for default storage class.

# Choose Uniform for Access control and uncheck Enforce public access prevention on this bucket to turn it off.

# Leave the rest of the fields as their default values and click Create.

# That's it â€” you've just created a Cloud Storage bucket!

# Note: If you are prompted with Public access will be prevented, uncheck Enforce public access prevention on this bucket and click Confirm.
